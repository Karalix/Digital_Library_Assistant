# Digital_Library_Assistant
Research Training Project for my Master's Degree. The goal is to provide library users with a new way to discover digital content using smartphones.

Nowadays most libraries provide access to large collections of ebooks. Unfortunately, those collections are only accessible through old web interfaces that do not permit the apparition of [serendipity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serendipity).

The aim of this project is to provide the user with meaningful suggestions on his smartphone based on his location in the library. To achieve this we use iBeacons to identify what are the nearest collections in the area.
